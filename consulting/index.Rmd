We focus on high value-added data projects at rapidly growing technology companies.

Our engagement process is very thourough. It involves a deep conversation with a technical member of our staff. Sales people are not and will never be involved. To make sure that's the case, we have a working EQ (i.e. Empathy IQ) engine for all written conversations. Yes, we are very serious about this "no-sales" commitment.

**Inspecting one company's data** is like having a doctor ask the patient to take off his pants. Its very revealing! While it might be tempting to seek out a tool specialist when you need one, best results are achieved with a general practitioner. Collectively we are vendor/technology agnostic. We do have some vendor partnership for legacy reasons, but we are not afraid to make recommendations counter to these (and frequently do).

## Analytics

Google BigQuery is a [partner technology](https://cloud.google.com/partners/directory/#?q=caura#search). We have completed many BQ projects of different complexity (both in Legacy and StandardSQL).

We also have a close relationship with Looker. This [post](https://s2blogs.com/why-did-i-become-a-data-consultant-and-a-looker-partner-7963c3e07508) from 2016 might be helpful.

R is our favorite tool. We like using R in almost all projects. We even pushed it into  [corporate thinking](https://looker.com/blog/predict-lending-clubs-loan-portfolio-returns-using-hp-vertica-looker-and-distributed-r).

## Data Warehousing

When strong data governance is in place, we can help make proactive recommendations using [traditional approach](https://discourse.looker.com/t/designing-a-data-warehouse-what-would-a-bi-solution-recommend/1231/5) and helping you put plans into place to maintain the architecture [post-deployment](https://discourse.looker.com/t/optimize-query-performance-with-lookml-a-case-study/1219).

At many companies the above no longer is feasible. We can help with long-term process and plan to monitor performance objectives against analytical needs.

## DNN, NLP

This is becoming a growing field for us. Please contact for further details. Also, see the product below.

### Entropy AI

Entropy gleans its insights from deep NLU (subtopic in NLP) analysis of written communication.

Examples:

1)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
entropy:analyze('Hello, we are on a mission to change how consulting is done.')
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
c("Result","driven","Passive voice","Concise","Informal","Thoughtful", "Assertive")
```

2)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
entropy:analyze("Don't get us wrong, we love sales people. They are nice people. We like spending time with them. But we also belief that in consulting a direct connection with a technical member is key to a successful engagement.")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
c("Positive","Formal","Verbose")
```


There is a lot of recent research that contributed to this product. For the purpose of simplicity, recall the Maximum likelihood models from graduate school. At its core this is a variation, in a simplified form called **Max Entropy**:
